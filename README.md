# TenoxUI Library

## About

Explore various classes, styles, and components built with TenoxUI (css framework).

## Classes

TenoxUI is used to built classes, styles, and component. Quick learn about TenoxUI css framework :

### Adding class through element

The style will applied into element immediately. So, you don't need to add new css file, the style will applied through element.

input => `mt-35px` : Set `margin-top` property.

output => `margin-top: 35px;`

### Manipulating styles

If you have element that have same `property`, TenoxUI will override of first class and use the last class instead.

Try this out :

HTML :

```html
<h1 class="tc-red">Hello Dev!</h1>
<h1 class="tc-red tc-blue">Hello Dev!</h1>

```
The first heading will have `color: red`. For the second tag, the `tc-red` will ignored and use the `color: blue` instead.

### Adding custom type and property

In TenoxUI css framework, there's variable called `type` and `propertiy`. `type` is what class that will used to trigger the styling. `property` is what css property that will trigered after we call its `type` that we already define, `property` must be an array.

Parameter :
```json
{type: property}
```

Usage :
```js
props = {
  "my-props": ["property1", "property2"],
}
```

#### Knowing what you do

Let's say we've defined type and property

### Give multiple style in one class

You can stack classes and use it as style for your element in the future. And you can achive it using :

#### `makeStyle` function

This function will stack style only for one element

Parameter :
```js
makeStyle(selector, classes)
```

- `selector` : Add selector you want to give the style.
- `classes` : Stacked TenoxUI Framework classes you want to add to the style.

Simple Usage :

```js

makeStyle(".my-button", "p-10px br-5px bg-[primary]");

```
This code will make style for `every` HTML element that have `my-button` className.

#### `makeStyles` function

It's basically same as `makeStyle` func, just with additional `s` in the end of its name üòÖ. 

`makeStyles` is a function you need to give style for different elements and selectors needed

Parameter :
```js
let param = {
  selector1: classes1,
  selector2: classes2
}

makeStyles(param)
```
`makeStyles` only need one parameter, and its an object.

Usage : 

```js
makeStyles({

  // from className
  ".my-btn": "p-10px br-8px fs-1rem",

  // Add multiple selector like css
  ".fx-ctr, .flex-center": "display-flex jc-center ai-center",

  // From id
  "#my-sec": "w-100% h-mn-100vh",

})

```
You can add selector you want except `pseudo` selector.
