### Adding class through element

The style will applied into element immediately. So, you don't need to add new css file, the style will applied through element.

input => `mt-35px` : Set `margin-too` property.

output => `margin-top: 35px;`

### Manipulating styles

If you have element that have same `property`, TenoxUI will override of first class and use the last class instead.

Try this out :

HTML :

```html
<h1 class="tc-red">Hello Dev!</h1>
<h1 class="tc-red tc-blue">Hello Dev!</h1>

```
The first heading will have `color: red`. For the second tag, the `tc-red` will ignored and use the `color: blue` instead.
